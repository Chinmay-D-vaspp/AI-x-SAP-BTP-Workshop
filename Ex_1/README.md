# Exercise 1: Create SAP Build Apps project

## Overview

This document outlines the steps required to create a new project in SAP Build Apps, SAPâ€™s no-code/low-code development tool on the Business Technology Platform (BTP). It is intended for users looking to quickly initiate an application project using the intuitive visual development environment provided by SAP Build Apps.

The guide covers the initial setup process, including:

*   Accessing SAP Build Apps via SAP BTP Cockpit
*   Starting a new project from scratch or using a template
*   Defining project metadata such as the name, description, and app type (web or mobile)
*   Understanding the project workspace structure (Canvas, Pages, Data, Variables, Logic)
*   Saving and managing the project within the SAP Build environment

This overview serves as a starting point for developers and business users to establish the foundation of their app, before moving on to designing the user interface, adding logic, and connecting to data sources.

## Steps to create a project
